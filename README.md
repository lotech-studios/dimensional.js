#### Module based Javascript 3D game engine

An easy to understand JavaScript ECS game engine. The 3D rendering and is based on Three.js. Super easy to use and understand if you have worked with frameworks like Three.js before. Since this is uses the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, it makes creating and handling entities super easy.

### Usage
The code below does the same thing as the Three.js example program on the github page except it utilizes the built-in ECS to create and modify the mesh.
