#### Module based Javascript 3D game engine

An easy to understand JavaScript ECS game engine. The 3D rendering and is based on [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). Super easy to use and understand if you have worked with frameworks like [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) before. Since this is uses the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, it makes creating and handling entities super easy.

### Usage
The code below does the same thing as the [Three.js example program](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#usage) on their github page except it utilizes the built-in ECS to create and modify the mesh.
